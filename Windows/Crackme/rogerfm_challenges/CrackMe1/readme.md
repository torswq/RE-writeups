## Walktrough
------------------------
This was an easy one, as it is the #1 challenge (You upload the flags to rogerfm.net)<br>
First of all i check it with PEiD if it was packed, it was not but it give me the information of the compiler, the compiler was MASM/TASM<br>
Second i started looking and the hexdump, and found some numbers, and i tried them and they work, since the input is only numbers.
